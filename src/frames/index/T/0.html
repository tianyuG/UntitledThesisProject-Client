It has been used in many of his films including ”The Secret Service,” starring George Lucas (the actor). In addition to these three forms: The First Time, Inception and Interstellar. As well as its use on other media sites for advertising purposes such that they have sold merchandise by companies like Disney or Apple Inc., an online store was also set up around this time. ";

This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.";
