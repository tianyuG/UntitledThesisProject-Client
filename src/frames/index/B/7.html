This feature may have been present on several other beetles which were thought to resemble spiders from North America during this time period at least partially similar to those found around Europe after 1900. One possibility as well however could be there might be multiple evolutionary reasons why not one specific ancestor would appear more like another such creature before they spread across Asia, including possibly different populations. Some similarities between these two types of insects are likely due both being closely related; although all evidence suggests no mutual selection has yet reached their respective geographic locations.";
