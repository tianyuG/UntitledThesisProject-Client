Cytisus purpureus), which bears some shoots typical of the one species, some of the other, and some which are a peculiar mixture of both ”parents”.";

Mr Hochschild continued, though not always so enthusiastic over this discovery. He noted how there were various varieties within our genus called dengue but also more exotic plants whose populations ranged greatly [sic].
