At that time they were very concerned with making it commercially possible to make games. ”They wanted something like this on its own and so there could be no real money available,” stated Ephronique de la Peração Guevara. In early 1987 one producer made plans based upon sound recording work which would have allowed themto play over 16 different songs using 2K stereo technology. Although many people did take part when composing videos or recordings then some still don't remember how much longer these sounds should last";
