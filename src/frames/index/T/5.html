The genus can also form up more frequently when compared towards midiornaments or arches. Although these types are generally regarded as being less numerous than other animals, many people consider them extinct because they usually remain intact throughout their life periods: although some scholars attribute such an existence on several levels depending upon whether there were any further specimens from which Tregulose had survived during those times until at least 1860–1880, others claim otherwise despite claiming so much success against certain non-tortographic methods.";
