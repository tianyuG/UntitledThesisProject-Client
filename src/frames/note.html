      <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
      <p>
        As you know, from the potato ricer that you too may have received in
        lieu of annual bonus to heavy excavators that were used to build part of
        the magnificant Wardle Canal, Pitchman-Survoy Inc. is known for its
        dependable household appliances and mechanical industrial products. But
        people outside of our legal and finance departments are rarely aware
        that we also have a publishing subdivision. When Pitchman Industries and
        Survoy Group International proposed a merger eight years ago, U.S.
        Department of Commerce and Canadian Chamber of Commerce imposed a few
        conditions for the merger to clear, citing antitrust concerns. While
        most of these conditions pertain to divestiture, one requirement
        stipulated that Thibodeau Publishing, an affiliate of Survoy Group
        International that reprint rare books and manuscripts, would remain
        operational within the new entity for at least 10 years. While our
        friends at Thibodeau are immensely proud of their heritage in metal
        type, we believe that the digital technology will become far more
        prevalent in the near future. Therefore, we remain hopeful that with a
        little help and technical know-how from my department, Thibodeau can
        finally come up with a commerical success and see a turnaround for the
        first time in their history.
      </p>
      <p>
        My team and our friends at Thibodeau went back and forth and landed on
        the decision to convert every volume of Encyclopaedia Mundi in digital
        form. Our initial market research indicated that we have to opt for an
        aggresive compression rate so that our database can fit on the disk
        space of an average target customer, but this also means that data needs
        to be decompressed on the fly, and the result may not show up
        instantaneously. However, we hope that the cost of purchasing high
        capacity hard disk dirves can lower over time, we would be able to sell
        a version with faster performance–albeit taking up more hard disk
        space–as a future upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I cannot be thankful enough for our friends at Thibodeau
        Publishing. Our partnership has allowed us to digitize a majority of the
        Encyclopaedia Mundi. Even though you may bump into a not-yet-digitized
        article once in a while, rest assured that me and my colleagues are
        working on it. If you happen to go on a business trip to Quebec (or as
        they say it up there, Québec), you need to allot some time to visit
        their storage just to appreciate how much physical space those delicate
        leather-bound books actually take up. If I had to be frank, our digital
        version just doesn't do it justice in that regard. Yet.
