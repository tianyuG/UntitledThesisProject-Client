    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <div id="typ">
      <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
      <p>Thank you for trying out Encyclopaedia Mundi.</p>
      <p>
        While the development is still underway, we are excited to give you an
        early preview of what it can achieve. Please understand that while we
        were able to design this software to be fully Y2K-compliant from the
        ground up, there may still be underlying issues (or &lsquo;bugs&rsquo;,
        as we say) regarding stability or incomplete data. If you encountered
        any problem, we&rsquo;d appreciate if you can spare us some time and
        visit \\encm on Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer to file a bug
        report so we can fix it in the near future. Please understand that this
        Intranet address is only accessible from our internal network. While
        we&rsquo;re at it, we also kindly ask you NOT to distribute this
        software to non-employees.
      </p>

        As you know, from the potato ricer that you too may have received in
        lieu of annual bonus to heavy excavators that were used to build part of
        the magnificant Wardle Canal, Pitchman-Survoy Inc. is known for its
        dependable household appliances and mechanical industrial products. But
        people outside of our legal and finance departments are rarely aware
        that we also have a publishing subdivision. When Pitchman Industries and
        Survoy Group International proposed a merger eight years ago, U.S.
        Department of Commerce and Canadian Chamber of Commerce imposed a few
        conditions for the merger to clear, citing antitrust concerns. One of
        such requirements is to ensure Thibodeau Publishing, an affiliate of
        Survoy Group International that reprint rare books and manuscripts,
        remains operational within the new entity for at least 10 years. While
        our friends at Thibodeau are immensely proud of their heritage in metal
        type, we believe that the digital technology will become far more
        prevalent in the near future. Therefore, we remain hopeful that with a
        little help and technical know-how from my department, Thibodeau can
        finally come up with a commerical success and see a turnaround for the
        first time in their history. (hinting they'll be shut down otherwise)
