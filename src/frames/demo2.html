    <h1>Alcest</h1>
    <div>Alcest is a French blackgaze and post-metal band from Bagnols-sur-Cèze, founded and led by Neige (Stéphane
        Paut). It
        began in 2000 as a black metal solo project by Neige, soon a trio, but following the release of their first demo
        in
        2001, band members Aegnor and Argoth left the band, leaving Neige as the sole member. The band played their
        third album,
        The New World Records, in 2002 as a group formed after a difficult time in the world. At that time, Neige had
        not been
        able to produce a full album and was still touring all over Europe. The album was released at a cost of about
        $15,000,
        but at the end of 2003, the band started producing full albums for the rest of Europe.
    </div>
    <div>After releasing the album, Aegnor went on hiatus with his solo record 'B' on November 11, 2004. In the years
        since,
        Aegnor has continued to play music , with numerous solo work, recording music, and live performances, and
        working as an
        arranger for the band. Alcest has also worked with many bands on the international tour, including Black Veil,
        the band
        who won the World Jazz Music Festival and the International Grand Prix of Music.</div>
