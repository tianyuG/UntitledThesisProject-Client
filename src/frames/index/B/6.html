Additionally this investigation focused solely upon soccer operations under certain circumstances while seeking public support through various forms thereof—including those involved therein--to uncover potential bribes involving players like Javier Pinto, Benito Floriani Jr., Luis Enrique Fonseca and Juan Manuel Salazar.
