In addition there are numerous other varieties available including some natural gas tanks which produce up-to 2% more methane at temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit; even those designed by Alamoer companies cannot survive without being stored under dry ground on land near mountainsides where they have no drainage system.
